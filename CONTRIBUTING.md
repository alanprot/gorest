# How to contribute

We love pull requests. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors
to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Make commits with clean commit messages.
* Make sure your changes are formatted using [gofmt](http://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/).
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting Changes

* Submit a pull request to the repository in the HourlyHost organization.

## Waiting

Waiting sucks. We will respond to or accept your pull request within one
day, weekday or weekend.
